## Description

_{This is a two person dice game. The players take turns rolling dice, seeing who will be the first to get to a score of 100. Anytime the player rolls a "1", their turn as well as all of the rolled numbers from their current turn are discarded, while all other numbers up the "6" are included in their combined score for their current turn.}_
